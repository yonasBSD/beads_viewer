{"id":"bv-133","title":"Unified Triage Intelligence","description":"# Unified Triage Intelligence: The Mega Command\n\n**This is THE primary entry point for AI agents using bv.**\n\n## Vision\n\nInstead of agents calling 5-10 different robot commands and mentally merging results, `--robot-triage` provides EVERYTHING an agent needs in ONE call:\n\n- What should I work on? (recommendations)\n- Are there fires to put out? (alerts)\n- Who else is working? (team awareness)\n- Will I conflict with anyone? (file conflicts)\n- What's the project health? (stats, graph, labels)\n- Any handoffs waiting for me? (collaboration)\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **One call = full context** - Agent calls triage once, has everything\n2. **Critical first** - Alerts before recommendations\n3. **Actionable throughout** - Every section says what to DO\n4. **Self-documenting** - Output explains itself\n5. **Team-aware** - Multi-agent coordination built-in\n6. **Progressive detail** - Summaries by default, deep-dive commands available\n\n## Output Structure (Priority Order)\n\n```\n1. meta           - Command info, timestamp, data hash\n2. quick_ref      - One-line summary for fast parsing\n3. alerts         - Critical issues FIRST (fires before features)\n4. top_pick       - THE #1 recommendation with full reasoning\n5. your_session   - Your claims, handoffs, context\n6. team           - Other agents, conflicts, available tracks\n7. recommendations- Next 5 items after top_pick\n8. quick_wins     - Low-effort high-impact items\n9. blockers       - Items that unblock the most work\n10. project_health- Stats, graph health, label health, drift\n11. suggestions   - Hygiene hints (missing deps, stale claims)\n12. commands      - Exact commands for next steps\n```\n\n## Relationship to Other Commands\n\n`--robot-triage` INCLUDES summaries from:\n- Agent Swarm (team, your_session, conflicts)\n- Proactive Alerts (alerts section)\n- Priority scoring (recommendations, top_pick)\n- Labels View (project_health.labels)\n- Execution Plan (available tracks)\n- History (your_session context)\n- Drift (project_health.drift)\n- Suggestions (suggestions section)\n\nIndividual commands remain for DEEP DIVES:\n- `--robot-plan` for full execution tracks\n- `--robot-insights` for complete graph metrics\n- `--robot-agents` for detailed agent activity\n- `--robot-alerts` for full alert details\n- `--robot-history` for commit correlation\n\n## Companion: --robot-next\n\nFor agents that just want ONE answer:\n```bash\nbv --robot-next  # Returns ONLY top_pick, nothing else\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nAn AI agent should be able to:\n1. Call `--robot-triage` at session start\n2. Immediately understand what to work on\n3. Know if there are any critical issues\n4. See team context without additional calls\n5.

{"id":"bv-147","title":"Implement unified scoring algorithm","description":"INCREMENTAL ENHANCEMENT on existing scoring\n\n## What Already Exists (DO NOT DUPLICATE)\n- `pkg/analysis/priority.go:ComputeImpactScores()` - composite scoring\n- Existing weights: PageRank(30%), Betweenness(30%), BlockerRatio(20%), Staleness(10%), PriorityBoost(10%)\n- `pkg/analysis/priority.go:ScoreBreakdown` - individual component tracking\n\n## What This Adds (NEW VALUE)\nTRIAGE-specific scoring that EXTENDS base scoring with:\n1. Label health factor (from bv-99 labels view) - boost items in unhealthy labels\n2. Agent claim factor (from bv-132) - reduce score for claimed items\n3. Unblock impact factor - boost items that unblock many others\n4. Quick-win factor - boost small items with high impact ratio\n\n## Incremental Implementation (Graceful Degradation)\n\n**Phase 1 (MVP):** Works with existing scoring only\n```go\nTriageScore = ComputeImpactScores() // 100% weight\n```\n\n**Phase 2 (Labels ready):** Add label health\n```go\nTriageScore = BaseScore*0.7 + LabelHealthBoost*0.15 + UnblockBoost*0.15\n```\n\n**Phase 3 (Agent Swarm ready):** Add claim penalty\n```go\nif claimedByOther { TriageScore *= 0.1 } // Heavily penalize claimed items\n```\n\n**Phase 4 (Attention scores ready):** Refine label factor\n```go\n// Replace simple label health with attention-weighted health\nLabelHealthBoost = labelAttentionScore * 0.15\n```\n\n## Key Principle\nStart simple, enhance incrementally.

This enables long-horizon task coordination by providing dashboards for feature areas (feat:auth), work types (fixes, ui), and epic progress tracking.\n\n## Inspiration\nBased on @kraitsura's Labels Viewer concept showing:\n- Label selector with fuzzy search and progress bars\n- Dashboard view grouping by EPICS and LABELS  \n- Completion tracking (X/Y format with visual progress)\n- Dependency depth toggle\n\n## User Stories\n- As a project lead, I want to see progress across feature areas at a glance\n- As a developer, I want to quickly filter to issues with a specific label\n- As a team, we want to track epic completion with roll-up statistics\n- As anyone, I want fuzzy search to find labels quickly\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. Label Selector (Overlay)\n- Fuzzy searchable picker accessible via \\`l\\` key from any view\n- Shows all labels and epics with progress bars\n- X/Y format showing completed vs total\n- Checkmarks for 100% complete labels\n\n### 2. Label Dashboard View  \n- Dedicated view showing label statistics\n- Two sections: EPICS (issues with type=epic) and LABELS\n- Progress bars with completion percentages\n- Expandable to drill into issues per label\n- Section cycling: Ready/Blocked/InProgress/Closed\n\n### 3. Dependency Depth Toggle\n- \\`d\\` key cycles through 1/2/3/All depth levels\n- Controls how deeply to show dependency chains\n- Current depth shown in status bar\n\n### 4. Visual Enhancements\n- Distinction between labeled and unlabeled issues\n- Epic progress roll-up from child issues\n- Quick jump from dashboard to filtered list\n\n## Keybindings\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| l | Open label selector (global) |\n| Enter | Select label / Confirm |\n| Esc | Close selector / Back |\n| j/k | Navigate |\n| Tab | Cycle sections |\n| d | Cycle dependency depth |\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] \\`l\\` key opens label selector from any view\n- [ ] Dashboard shows accurate progress for all labels\n- [ ] Fuzzy search finds labels quickly\n- [ ] Epic completion rolls up from children\n- [ ] Dependency depth toggle works smoothly\n\n## Implementation Phases\n1. **Phase 1**: Label statistics extraction and data model\n2. **Phase 2**: Label selector UI with fuzzy search\n3. **Phase 3**: Label dashboard view\n4. **Phase 4**: Integration, depth toggle, polish","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-15T15:48:59.347877-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:55:52.993952-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-15T15:55:52.993952-05:00","labels":["epic","feature","labels-view","tui"]}

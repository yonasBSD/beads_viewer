{"id":"bv-133","title":"Unified Triage Intelligence","description":"# Unified Triage Intelligence: The Mega Command\n\n**This is THE primary entry point for AI agents using bv.**\n\n## Vision\n\nInstead of agents calling 5-10 different robot commands and mentally merging results, `--robot-triage` provides EVERYTHING an agent needs in ONE call:\n\n- What should I work on? (recommendations)\n- Are there fires to put out? (alerts)\n- Who else is working? (team awareness)\n- Will I conflict with anyone? (file conflicts)\n- What's the project health? (stats, graph, labels)\n- Any handoffs waiting for me? (collaboration)\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **One call = full context** - Agent calls triage once, has everything\n2. **Critical first** - Alerts before recommendations\n3. **Actionable throughout** - Every section says what to DO\n4. **Self-documenting** - Output explains itself\n5. **Team-aware** - Multi-agent coordination built-in\n6. **Progressive detail** - Summaries by default, deep-dive commands available\n\n## Output Structure (Priority Order)\n\n```\n1. meta           - Command info, timestamp, data hash\n2. quick_ref      - One-line summary for fast parsing\n3. alerts         - Critical issues FIRST (fires before features)\n4. top_pick       - THE #1 recommendation with full reasoning\n5. your_session   - Your claims, handoffs, context\n6. team           - Other agents, conflicts, available tracks\n7. recommendations- Next 5 items after top_pick\n8. quick_wins     - Low-effort high-impact items\n9. blockers       - Items that unblock the most work\n10. project_health- Stats, graph health, label health, drift\n11. suggestions   - Hygiene hints (missing deps, stale claims)\n12. commands      - Exact commands for next steps\n```\n\n## Relationship to Other Commands\n\n`--robot-triage` INCLUDES summaries from:\n- Agent Swarm (team, your_session, conflicts)\n- Proactive Alerts (alerts section)\n- Priority scoring (recommendations, top_pick)\n- Labels View (project_health.labels)\n- Execution Plan (available tracks)\n- History (your_session context)\n- Drift (project_health.drift)\n- Suggestions (suggestions section)\n\nIndividual commands remain for DEEP DIVES:\n- `--robot-plan` for full execution tracks\n- `--robot-insights` for complete graph metrics\n- `--robot-agents` for detailed agent activity\n- `--robot-alerts` for full alert details\n- `--robot-history` for commit correlation\n\n## Companion: --robot-next\n\nFor agents that just want ONE answer:\n```bash\nbv --robot-next  # Returns ONLY top_pick, nothing else\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nAn AI agent should be able to:\n1. Call `--robot-triage` at session start\n2. Immediately understand what to work on\n3. Know if there are any critical issues\n4. See team context without additional calls\n5.

The 'dimmed' text (Subtext, Muted colors) is nearly invisible on white backgrounds, making the application unusable for users with light terminal themes.\n\n## User Impact\n\n**Severity: High (P1)**\n- Effectively blocks users with light terminal themes\n- Affects readability of secondary information (dimmed text, hints)\n- Reported by @mikker in GitHub Issue #17\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Location:** `pkg/ui/theme.go:41-64`\n\nThe theme uses `lipgloss.AdaptiveColor` which provides Light/Dark values:\n\n```go\nSubtext: lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: \"#999999\", Dark: \"#BFBFBF\"}\nMuted:   lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: \"#888888\", Dark: \"#6272A4\"}\n```\n\nThe Light values are too light for white backgrounds:\n- `#999999` on white = contrast ratio ~2.8:1 (WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 for normal text)\n- `#888888` on white = contrast ratio ~3.5:1 (still fails WCAG AA)\n\nWhile lipgloss attempts auto-detection of terminal background color, the chosen Light values are simply too faint regardless.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Fix 1: Improve Light mode color contrast\n\n```go\n// Improved light mode colors (WCAG AA compliant)\nSubtext: lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: \"#666666\", Dark: \"#BFBFBF\"} // ~6:1 contrast\nMuted:   lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: \"#555555\", Dark: \"#6272A4\"} // ~7:1 contrast\n```\n\nAll colors need review:\n- Primary: #7D56F4 on white = ~4.6:1 (barely passes)\n- Secondary: #555555 is good\n- Status colors need verification\n\n### Fix 2 (Optional): Add explicit theme flag\n\n```bash\nbv --theme=light   # Force light mode colors\nbv --theme=dark    # Force dark mode colors\nbv --theme=auto    # Default: auto-detect (current behavior)\n```\n\nThis helps when auto-detection fails or user preference differs.\n\n## Color Audit Required\n\nAll AdaptiveColor values need contrast verification:\n\n| Color | Current Light | Contrast | Suggested Light | New Contrast |\n|-------|--------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Subtext | #999999 | 2.8:1 ❌ | #666666 | 6:1 ✓ |\n| Muted | #888888 | 3.5:1 ❌ | #555555 | 7:1 ✓ |\n| Secondary | #555555 | 7:1 ✓ | Keep | - |\n| Open | #00A800 | 2.7:1 ❌ | #007700 | 4.6:1 ✓ |\n| Closed | #555555 | 7:1 ✓ | Keep | - |\n| Border | #DDDDDD | 1.4:1 ❌ | #AAAAAA | 2.3:1 (border OK) |\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1.

{"id":"bv-3ht4","title":"openInEditor Uses Hardcoded Path Instead of Configured beadsPath","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe 'O' keybinding to open the beads file in editor fails when the file isn't named exactly `beads.jsonl`. The `openInEditor()` function hardcodes the path instead of using the `beadsPath` field already stored in the Model.\n\n## User Impact\n\n**Severity: High (P1)**\n- Fails silently or shows error for projects using `issues.jsonl`\n- beads upstream uses `issues.jsonl` as canonical, not `beads.jsonl`\n- Reported by @qmx in GitHub PR #18\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Location:** `pkg/ui/model.go:2945-2955`\n\n```go\nfunc (m *Model) openInEditor() {\n    cwd, err := os.Getwd()\n    // ...\n    beadsFile := filepath.Join(cwd, \".beads\", \"beads.jsonl\")  // HARDCODED!\n    if _, err := os.Stat(beadsFile); os.IsNotExist(err) {\n        m.statusMsg = \"No .beads/beads.jsonl file found\"  // Wrong error message\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe Model already has a `beadsPath` field (line 138) that's set during initialization and used for file watching. This function ignores it.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe beads project documentation (pre-commit hook) states:\n\u003e Stage all tracked JSONL files (issues.jsonl is canonical, beads.jsonl for backward compat)\n\nSo the hardcoded `beads.jsonl` path is wrong for the canonical case.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n```go\nfunc (m *Model) openInEditor() {\n    if m.beadsPath == \"\" {\n        m.statusMsg = \"No beads file configured\"\n        m.statusIsError = true\n        return\n    }\n\n    if _, err := os.Stat(m.beadsPath); os.IsNotExist(err) {\n        m.statusMsg = fmt.Sprintf(\"Beads file not found: %s\", m.beadsPath)\n        m.statusIsError = true\n        return\n    }\n    \n    // Continue with m.beadsPath instead of hardcoded path...\n}\n```\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Test: openInEditor with beadsPath set to issues.jsonl - should work\n2. Test: openInEditor with beadsPath empty - should show \"No beads file configured\"\n3. Test: openInEditor with beadsPath pointing to non-existent file - should show path in error\n4. Manual test: 'O' key works for both beads.jsonl and issues.jsonl projects\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Uses m.beadsPath instead of hardcoded path\n- [ ] Error messages include actual file path for debugging\n- [ ] Works for issues.jsonl, beads.jsonl, and any other valid jsonl file\n- [ ] Tests cover all error paths\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Blocked by:** bv-mvvu (Data Integrity: Merge Artifact Files)\n- The beadsPath value depends on correct file selection\n- Fix the loader first, then this will use the correct path\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub PR #18: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/pull/18\n- beads pre-commit hook documentation on canonical file names","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:52:16.050304-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T00:20:26.597794-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T00:20:26.597794-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed: openInEditor now uses m.beadsPath instead of hardcoded 'beads.jsonl'.

Unlike the current help overlay (which is modal and blocks interaction), this would be a persistent panel that can be shown/hidden while continuing to work.\n\n## User Request\n\nFrom @austinm911 in GitHub Issue #8:\n\u003e Not sure if anyone would find this helpful but there are a lot of shortcuts here so I am always using ? to view them (unable to scroll this view on Warp terminal). It would be nice to have a keyboard shortcuts panel that could be toggled on/off so we can see the rest of the panels.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nbv has 60+ keyboard shortcuts across multiple contexts. Learning these shortcuts improves efficiency, but the current modal help overlay:\n1. Blocks the main view while open\n2. Cannot be scrolled on some terminals (separate bug: bv-43js)\n3. Must be reopened each time you forget a shortcut\n\n## Proposed Approaches\n\n### Option A: Persistent Sidebar (Recommended)\n\nA right-side panel that can be toggled on/off. Toggle with a key like F2 or Shift+?. Shows shortcuts organized by category, scrollable within the sidebar.\n\n### Option B: Context-Sensitive Status Bar\n\nShow relevant shortcuts in the footer based on current view/focus. Less intrusive but shows fewer shortcuts.\n\n### Option C: Compact Floating Panel\n\nA smaller overlay that does not cover the entire screen.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n1. Width impact: Sidebar reduces main content width\n2. Context awareness: Show shortcuts relevant to current view/focus\n3. Persistence: Remember toggle state across sessions?\n4. Customization: Allow users to choose which shortcuts to show?\n\n## Priority Justification\n\nP4 (Backlog) because:\n- Nice-to-have, not critical functionality\n- Help overlay serves the basic need (once scroll bug is fixed)\n- Requires significant UI work\n- Should implement after help overlay scroll (bv-43js)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBlocked by: bv-43js (Help Overlay Scroll)\n- Fix the existing help system first\n- Learn from help scroll implementation patterns\n- Sidebar might reuse scroll logic\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1.

{"id":"bv-43js","title":"Help Overlay Cannot Be Scrolled on Small Terminals","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe help overlay (triggered by '?' or F1) displays all keyboard shortcuts in a fixed box. On terminals smaller than the content height, the help content is cut off with no way to scroll and see the remaining shortcuts.\n\n## User Impact\n\n**Severity: Medium (P2)**\n- Affects discoverability of keyboard shortcuts\n- Particularly problematic on smaller screens or split terminal panes\n- User @austinm911 mentioned this in GitHub Issue #8\n- Identified during PR #16 review from @kraitsura\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Location:** `pkg/ui/model.go:1731-1889` (`renderHelpOverlay` function)\n\nThe function builds a string with all shortcuts and renders it in a fixed box:\n\n```go\nhelpBox := t.Renderer.NewStyle().\n    Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).\n    BorderForeground(t.Primary).\n    Padding(1, 3).\n    Render(helpContent)  // All content, no scroll\n\nreturn lipgloss.Place(m.width, m.height-1, lipgloss.Center, lipgloss.Center, helpBox)\n```\n\nThere's no scroll state, no key handlers for navigation, and no visual indicator of content overflow.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe help overlay shows 60+ lines of keyboard shortcuts across multiple sections:\n- Navigation (9 items)\n- Views (7 items)\n- Graph View (4 items)\n- Insights Panel (5 items)\n- History View (7 items)\n- Filters (5 items)\n- General (7 items)\n\nEven on a 40-line terminal, much of this content is hidden.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Add scroll support to help overlay\n\n1. **Add scroll state to Model:**\n   ```go\n   helpScroll int // Current scroll offset for help overlay\n   ```\n\n2. **Handle navigation keys when help focused:**\n   ```go\n   case focusHelp:\n       switch msg.String() {\n       case \"j\", \"down\":\n           m.helpScroll++\n       case \"k\", \"up\":\n           if m.helpScroll \u003e 0 { m.helpScroll-- }\n       case \"ctrl+d\":\n           m.helpScroll += 10\n       case \"ctrl+u\":\n           m.helpScroll = max(0, m.helpScroll-10)\n       case \"home\", \"g\":\n           m.helpScroll = 0\n       default:\n           // Any other key dismisses help\n           m.showHelp = false\n           m.helpScroll = 0\n       }\n   ```\n\n3. **Render visible portion with scroll indicator:**\n   - Calculate visible lines based on terminal height\n   - Clamp scroll position to valid range\n   - Show scroll position indicator (e.g., scrollbar or percentage)\n\n4. **Add navigation hint in help footer:**\n   ```\n   ↑↓ scroll │ q close │ ●───────── (scroll indicator)\n   ```\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n1. **Fixed width rendering**: Prevent box resize as content scrolls\n2. **Scroll indicator**: Show position in content (scrollbar or percentage)\n3. **Graceful degradation**: On very small terminals, show most important shortcuts first\n4. **Reset scroll on open**: Always start at top when reopening help\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Test: j/k keys scroll content up/down\n2. Test: Ctrl+d/u for page navigation\n3. Test: Home/g goes to top\n4. Test: Any non-navigation key closes help\n5. Test: Scroll resets to 0 on reopen\n6. Test: Scroll indicator updates correctly\n7. Manual test: Various terminal sizes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Help overlay scrollable with j/k, arrows, Ctrl+d/u\n- [ ] Visual scroll indicator shows position\n- [ ] Non-navigation keys still dismiss help\n- [ ] Scroll position resets when reopened\n- [ ] Works correctly at edge cases (top/bottom of content)\n- [ ] Fixed width prevents layout shift during scroll\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub PR #16: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/pull/16\n- GitHub Issue #8: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/issues/8 (related)\n- Related: Help content is extensive and growing with each feature","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:53:39.635197-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T10:43:46.204287-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T10:43:46.204287-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented scrollable help overlay with j/k/Ctrl+d/u/g/G navigation and scroll indicator","labels":["accessibility","gh-pr-16","ux"]}

port \u003c= end; port++ {\n        listener, err := net.Listen(\"tcp\", fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", port))\n        if err == nil {\n            listener.Close()\n            return port, nil\n        }\n    }\n    return 0, fmt.Errorf(\"no available port in range %d-%d\", start, end)\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Server starts and serves bundle\n- [ ] No-cache headers prevent stale content\n- [ ] Browser auto-opens on start\n- [ ] SSE hot reload works when files change\n- [ ] 'r' key regenerates export\n- [ ] 'd' key triggers deployment flow\n- [ ] 'q' key cleanly exits\n- [ ] Auto-selects available port if default in use\n- [ ] Works on macOS, Linux, Windows\n\n## Notes\n- Keep dependencies minimal (just std lib + fsnotify)\n- SSE is simpler than WebSocket for this use case\n- Hot reload is nice-to-have, not critical for MVP","notes":"REVISION (2025-12-16): Clarified MVP vs nice-to-have features.\n\n**MVP (Required):**\n- Static file server with no-cache headers\n- Auto-opens browser on start\n- Ctrl+C to stop\n- Port auto-selection if default in use\n\n**NICE-TO-HAVE (Phase 4):**\n- Hot reload via SSE\n- File watcher with fsnotify\n- 'r' to regenerate, 'd' to deploy, 'q' to quit controls\n- Manifest status endpoint\n\n**MVP Implementation:**\n```go\nfunc (p *PreviewServer) Start() error {\n    mux := http.NewServeMux()\n    \n    // Static file server with no-cache\n    fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir(p.bundlePath))\n    mux.Handle(\"/\", noCacheMiddleware(fs))\n    \n    p.server = \u0026http.Server{\n        Addr:    fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", p.port),\n        Handler: mux,\n    }\n    \n    // Open browser\n    go func() {\n        time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)\n        browser.OpenURL(fmt.Sprintf(\"http://localhost:%d\", p.port))\n    }()\n    \n    fmt.Printf(\"Preview server at http://localhost:%d\\n\", p.port)\n    fmt.Println(\"Press Ctrl+C to stop\")\n    \n    return p.server.ListenAndServe()\n}\n```\n\nThis simplification removes:\n- fsnotify dependency\n- SSE complexity\n- Interactive key handling\n\nThese can be added later as enhancements.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:09:29.111326-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T03:25:28.943321-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T03:25:28.943321-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented local preview server: PreviewServer with HTTP file serving, no-cache middleware, port auto-selection (9000-9100), browser auto-open, graceful shutdown.

{"id":"bv-5h6q","title":"Epic Emoji Inconsistent Across Codebase (VS-16 Issues)","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe epic issue type uses inconsistent emoji across the codebase. Some files use the mountain emoji with VS-16 variation selector (causes terminal width issues), while others were updated to use the rocket emoji. This inconsistency causes column misalignment in some terminal emulators.\n\n## User Impact\n\n**Severity: Medium (P2)**\n- Visual glitch causes column misalignment\n- Affects WezTerm, Alacritty, and other terminals with limited VS-16 support\n- Reported by @ghillb in GitHub Issue #6 with excellent technical analysis\n- Also affects keyboard emoji in help overlay per @rbergman\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### The VS-16 Problem\n\nUnicode Variation Selector-16 (U+FE0F) requests emoji presentation. The mountain emoji:\n- With VS-16: U+1F3D4 U+FE0F renders as 3 cells in many terminals\n- Without VS-16: U+1F3D4 renders as 2 cells consistently\n\nWezTerm has documented 0% VS-16 support, causing the emoji to occupy incorrect width.\n\n### Current Inconsistency\n\n**Already fixed (uses rocket):**\n- `pkg/ui/theme.go:108-110`: Returns \"rocket\" with comment explaining VS-16 issue\n\n**Still broken (uses mountain with VS-16):**\n- `pkg/ui/model.go:2596`: GetTypeIconMD() returns \"mountain\"\n- `pkg/export/markdown.go:323`: getTypeEmoji() returns \"mountain\"\n- Various tests reference the old emoji\n\n```\n  📋 P1 OPEN proj-abc Task item...\n  📋 P1 OPEN proj-def Another task...\n  🏔️  P1 OPEN proj-ghi Epic item...  ← misaligned (3 cells)\n  ✨ P2 OPEN proj-jkl Feature...\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Audit all emoji usage\n\nSearch for problematic emojis across codebase:\n- Mountain: U+1F3D4 (🏔️ with or without VS-16)\n- Keyboard: U+2328 U+FE0F (⌨️ in help overlay)\n- Any other emojis with VS-16\n\n### 2. Standardize to VS-16-free versions\n\n```go\n// theme.go already does this:\ncase \"epic\":\n    return \"rocket\", t.Epic  // No VS-16\n\n// Update model.go GetTypeIconMD():\nfunc GetTypeIconMD(typ string) string {\n    switch typ {\n    case \"epic\":\n        return \"rocket\"  // Changed from mountain\n    // ...\n    }\n}\n\n// Update export/markdown.go getTypeEmoji():\nfunc getTypeEmoji(typ string) string {\n    switch typ {\n    case \"epic\":\n        return \"rocket\"  // Changed from mountain\n    // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update tests\n\nEnsure all test expectations use the new emoji.\n\n### 4. Document emoji choices\n\nAdd comment in theme.go explaining why certain emojis are chosen and what to avoid.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n1. **Which emoji for epic?**\n   - Current fix uses rocket (no VS-16 issues)\n   - Could use books (📚) as suggested in issue\n   - Rocket makes sense: launch, major milestone\n   - **Decision**: Stick with rocket for consistency with theme.go fix\n\n2. **Should we strip VS-16 programmatically?**\n   - Could filter emojis at render time\n   - Adds complexity for edge case\n   - **Decision**: Use VS-16-free emojis directly (simpler)\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Verify all emoji definitions use VS-16-free versions\n2. Run grep/search for U+FE0F patterns\n3. Manual test in WezTerm (0% VS-16 support)\n4. Verify column alignment with mixed issue types\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All epic emojis use rocket (or chosen alternative)\n- [ ] No VS-16 (U+FE0F) in any emoji definitions\n- [ ] Columns align correctly in WezTerm\n- [ ] Tests updated to expect new emojis\n- [ ] Documentation added explaining emoji guidelines\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub Issue #6: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/issues/6\n- WezTerm VS-16 issue: https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues/3923\n- Unicode VS-16 terminal support: https://www.jeffquast.com/post/ucs-detect-test-results/\n- WezTerm UCS detection results (0% VS-16): https://ucs-detect.readthedocs.io/sw_results/wezterm.html","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:53:40.94919-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T10:46:28.545505-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T10:46:28.545505-05:00","close_reason":"Changed epic emoji from mountain (🏔️) to rocket (🚀) across all files to fix VS-16 width issues","labels":["display","gh-issue-6"]}
{"id":"bv-5mgw","title":"Rust WASM Graph Engine for Static Viewer","description":"# Rust WASM Graph Engine for Static Viewer\n\n## Overview\nAdd a Rust-compiled WASM module to the static viewer that enables **live graph calculations** on filtered data. Since we're already shipping sql.js WASM for database queries, adding a graph WASM module is a natural extension that unlocks powerful interactive features impossible with pre-computed data.\n\n## Motivation: Why WASM for Graph Calculations?\n\n### The Limitation of Pre-Computed Metrics\nThe current static export computes all graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, etc.) at export time and stores them in SQLite. This works well for full-dataset views, but falls short when users:\n\n1. **Filter to a subset**: PageRank of issues in the \"auth\" label ≠ pre-computed PageRank\n2. **Ask \"what-if\" questions**: \"If I close bv-123, what unblocks?\"\n3. **Explore dependencies**: \"Show me the critical path for just P1 issues\"\n4. **Analyze subgraphs**: \"Are there cycles within just the API work?\"\n\n### What Rust WASM Enables\nWith client-side graph computation, the static viewer can:\n\n- **Live PageRank**: Recompute centrality on any filtered subset\n- **What-If Simulation**: Preview cascade effects before closing issues\n- **Subgraph Analysis**: Detect cycles, critical paths within filtered views\n- **Impact Preview**: Hover to see downstream effects\n- **Dynamic Exploration**: \"What gets unblocked if I close these 3 issues?\"\n\n### Performance Comparison (estimated on 1000-node graph)\n| Algorithm | JavaScript | Rust WASM | Speedup |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| PageRank | ~200ms | ~5ms | 40x |\n| Betweenness | ~2000ms | ~50ms | 40x |\n| Cycle Detection | ~500ms | ~10ms | 50x |\n| Critical Path | ~100ms | ~3ms | 33x |\n| Topological Sort | ~50ms | ~2ms | 25x |\n\n### Bundle Size Impact\n- **bv_graph_bg.wasm**: ~80-120KB (wasm-opt optimized)\n- **bv_graph.js**: ~15KB (wasm-bindgen glue)\n- **Total**: ~100-135KB (acceptable;

Use pre-computed values from SQLite\n2. Disable live recalculation features\n3. Show \"Limited Mode\" indicator\n4. Graceful degradation - everything still works, just no live updates\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. WASM module loads reliably across browsers\n2. PageRank on 1000 nodes completes in \u003c50ms\n3. All algorithms match Go implementation results\n4. Bundle size increase \u003c150KB\n5. Fallback works when WASM unavailable\n6.

This enables long-horizon task coordination by providing dashboards for feature areas (feat:auth), work types (fixes, ui), and epic progress tracking.\n\n## Inspiration\nBased on @kraitsura's Labels Viewer concept showing:\n- Label selector with fuzzy search and progress bars\n- Dashboard view grouping by EPICS and LABELS  \n- Completion tracking (X/Y format with visual progress)\n- Dependency depth toggle\n\n## User Stories\n- As a project lead, I want to see progress across feature areas at a glance\n- As a developer, I want to quickly filter to issues with a specific label\n- As a team, we want to track epic completion with roll-up statistics\n- As anyone, I want fuzzy search to find labels quickly\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. Label Selector (Overlay)\n- Fuzzy searchable picker accessible via \\`l\\` key from any view\n- Shows all labels and epics with progress bars\n- X/Y format showing completed vs total\n- Checkmarks for 100% complete labels\n\n### 2. Label Dashboard View  \n- Dedicated view showing label statistics\n- Two sections: EPICS (issues with type=epic) and LABELS\n- Progress bars with completion percentages\n- Expandable to drill into issues per label\n- Section cycling: Ready/Blocked/InProgress/Closed\n\n### 3. Dependency Depth Toggle\n- \\`d\\` key cycles through 1/2/3/All depth levels\n- Controls how deeply to show dependency chains\n- Current depth shown in status bar\n\n### 4. Visual Enhancements\n- Distinction between labeled and unlabeled issues\n- Epic progress roll-up from child issues\n- Quick jump from dashboard to filtered list\n\n## Keybindings\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| l | Open label selector (global) |\n| Enter | Select label / Confirm |\n| Esc | Close selector / Back |\n| j/k | Navigate |\n| Tab | Cycle sections |\n| d | Cycle dependency depth |\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] \\`l\\` key opens label selector from any view\n- [ ] Dashboard shows accurate progress for all labels\n- [ ] Fuzzy search finds labels quickly\n- [ ] Epic completion rolls up from children\n- [ ] Dependency depth toggle works smoothly\n\n## Implementation Phases\n1. **Phase 1**: Label statistics extraction and data model\n2. **Phase 2**: Label selector UI with fuzzy search\n3. **Phase 3**: Label dashboard view\n4. **Phase 4**: Integration, depth toggle, polish","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-15T15:48:59.347877-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:55:52.993952-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-15T15:55:52.993952-05:00","labels":["epic","feature","labels-view","tui"]}

AI agents benefit from semantic retrieval for RAG patterns.\n\n## Value Proposition\n- For Humans: 'that thing about memory leaks' actually finds it\n- For AI Agents: RAG over project history - 'how did we solve similar issues before?'\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Local embeddings (start simple: sentence-transformers via subprocess or pure Go)\n2. Vector storage (sqlite-vec extension or simple flat file)\n3. Incremental indexing (embed on first access, update when issues change)\n4.

{"id":"bv-b23i","title":"Interactive Graph Visualization with Force-Graph","description":"# Interactive Graph Visualization with Force-Graph\n\n## Vision\nTransform the static viewer from a simple table into an **immersive, interactive graph exploration experience**. Using [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph) (WebGL-accelerated), users can explore their dependency graph visually, see patterns at a glance, and perform what-if analysis with beautiful animations.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### Current State: Tables Are Limiting\n- Users scroll through lists, mentally reconstructing relationships\n- Hard to see the \"big picture\" of work\n- Bottlenecks and cycles are numbers, not visible patterns\n- No way to explore \"what if I close this?\"\n\n### Future State: Visual Graph Intelligence\n- **See the shape** of your work at a glance\n- **Spot bottlenecks** as large, central nodes\n- **Find cycles** as visual loops\n- **Explore what-if** by clicking nodes and watching cascades\n- **Understand priority** through size, color, position\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1. Force-Directed Dependency Graph\n- Nodes = issues, sized by impact (PageRank/blocker count)\n- Edges = dependencies with directional arrows\n- Colors: green (closed), blue (open), orange (blocked), red (critical)\n- Smooth WebGL rendering for 1000+ nodes at 60fps\n- Click node to focus, hover for tooltip, drag to reorganize\n\n### 2. Visual What-If Analysis\n- Click any open issue to \"simulate close\"\n- Watch downstream unblocks animate (ripple effect)\n- See parallelization gain visually\n- Color transitions: blocked→unblocked nodes glow green\n- Reset button to restore original state\n\n### 3.

{"id":"bv-f103","title":"Labels Missing from Detail View Panel","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nLabels are NOT displayed in the detail view panel, even though they are a critical organizational feature. Users who rely on labels for categorization (e.g., `repo:web`, `area:backend`) cannot see this information when viewing issue details.\n\n## User Impact\n\n**Severity: High (P1)**\n- Labels completely hidden in the most detailed view\n- Users must use list view (width \u003e 140px) to see labels at all\n- Particularly problematic for multi-repo workflows using labels\n- Reported by @neilpoulin in GitHub Issue #14 with screenshot\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Location:** `pkg/ui/model.go:2401-2498` (`updateViewportContent` function)\n\nThe detail view renders:\n- Title with type icon ✓\n- Meta table (ID, Status, Priority, Assignee, Created) ✓\n- Graph Analysis metrics ✓\n- Description, Acceptance Criteria, Notes ✓\n- Dependency tree ✓\n- Comments ✓\n- History (if loaded) ✓\n\n**Missing:** Labels are never rendered\\!\n\nLabels ARE rendered in other contexts:\n- List view delegate (`pkg/ui/delegate.go:97-99`) - but only when width \u003e 140\n- Copy to clipboard (`pkg/ui/model.go:2909-2910`)\n- Kanban board (`pkg/ui/board.go:469-474`)\n\nBut `updateViewportContent()` simply doesn't include them.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd labels after the meta table, around line 2433:\n\n```go\n// After meta table, before Graph Analysis\nif len(item.Labels) \u003e 0 {\n    sb.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(\"**Labels:** %s\\n\\n\", strings.Join(item.Labels, \", \")))\n}\n```\n\nOr integrate into meta table as an additional row:\n\n```go\n// Extended meta table\nsb.WriteString(\"| ID | Status | Priority | Assignee | Created | Labels |\\n\")\nsb.WriteString(\"|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n\")\nlabelsStr := strings.Join(item.Labels, \", \")\nif labelsStr == \"\" { labelsStr = \"-\" }\nsb.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(\"| **%s** | **%s** | %s | @%s | %s | %s |\\n\\n\",\n    item.ID, strings.ToUpper(string(item.Status)), GetPriorityIcon(item.Priority),\n    item.Assignee, item.CreatedAt.Format(\"2006-01-02\"), labelsStr))\n```\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n1. **Placement**: Should labels be in the meta table or as a separate section?\n   - Meta table: Compact, consistent with other metadata\n   - Separate section: More prominent, can be styled differently\n   - **Recommendation**: Separate line after meta table for visibility\n\n2. **Styling**: How should labels be formatted?\n   - Simple comma-separated list (like clipboard function)\n   - Styled tags with background colors\n   - **Recommendation**: Start simple (comma-separated), enhance later if needed\n\n3. **Empty state**: What if issue has no labels?\n   - Don't render anything (current clipboard behavior)\n   - Show \"Labels: None\" explicitly\n   - **Recommendation**: Don't render if empty (cleaner)\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Test: Issue with multiple labels - all displayed\n2. Test: Issue with no labels - section not rendered\n3. Test: Issue with very long label list - wraps appropriately\n4. Manual test: Labels visible in detail view for user's screenshot scenario\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Labels displayed in detail view panel\n- [ ] No display when issue has no labels\n- [ ] Markdown renders correctly (no escaping issues)\n- [ ] Test coverage for with/without labels scenarios\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub Issue #14: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/issues/14\n- Screenshot in issue shows labels exist but don't display\n- Related code: delegate.go:97-99, board.go:469-474 (where labels DO render)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:52:17.913824-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T00:21:35.647305-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T00:21:35.647305-05:00","close_reason":"Added labels display to detail view after meta table, only renders when issue has labels","labels":["feature-gap","gh-issue-14","ux"]}

{"id":"bv-g4gs","title":"Installer Script: TMP_DIRS Unbound Variable Error with set -u","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe install.sh script fails with an unbound variable error after successful installation when run with strict bash settings. The error occurs during cleanup when iterating over the TMP_DIRS array.\n\n## User Impact\n\n**Severity: Medium (P2)**\n- Confusing error message after successful install\n- Only affects new installations\n- Reported by @tonywoode in GitHub Issue #7\n\n## Error Message\n\n```bash\n$ curl -fsSL \"...install.sh\" | bash\n==\u003e Installing bv...\n==\u003e Detected platform: darwin_arm64\n==\u003e Checking for pre-built binary...\n==\u003e Latest release: v0.10.2\n==\u003e Selected asset: bv_0.10.2_darwin_arm64.tar.gz\n==\u003e Downloading...\n==\u003e Extracting...\n==\u003e Installed bv v0.10.2 to /opt/homebrew/bin/bv\n==\u003e Run 'bv' in any beads project to view issues.\nbash: line 10: TMP_DIRS[@]: unbound variable    ← ERROR HERE\n```\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Location:** `install.sh:2,8-14`\n\n```bash\nset -euo pipefail  # -u makes unbound variables an error\n\nTMP_DIRS=()  # Empty array\n\ncleanup_tmp_dirs() {\n    local dir\n    for dir in \"${TMP_DIRS[@]}\"; do  # FAILS when array is empty\\!\n        [ -n \"$dir\" ] \u0026\u0026 rm -rf \"$dir\"\n    done\n}\n\ntrap cleanup_tmp_dirs EXIT\n```\n\nWith `set -u` (nounset), iterating over an empty array using `${TMP_DIRS[@]}` is an error in older bash versions. The array starts empty and if the binary install succeeds on the first try, no temp dirs are created.\n\n## Why Installation Still Works\n\nThe error occurs in the EXIT trap AFTER the main script completes successfully. The binary is already installed when the cleanup function runs and fails.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Fix: Use array expansion that handles empty arrays\n\n```bash\ncleanup_tmp_dirs() {\n    local dir\n    # Use ${array[@]+\"${array[@]}\"} pattern for empty array safety\n    for dir in \"${TMP_DIRS[@]+\"${TMP_DIRS[@]}\"}\"; do\n        [ -n \"$dir\" ] \u0026\u0026 rm -rf \"$dir\"\n    done\n}\n```\n\nThe `${var+value}` pattern returns nothing if var is unset/empty, avoiding the unbound error.\n\n### Alternative: Check array length first\n\n```bash\ncleanup_tmp_dirs() {\n    if [ ${#TMP_DIRS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then\n        local dir\n        for dir in \"${TMP_DIRS[@]}\"; do\n            [ -n \"$dir\" ] \u0026\u0026 rm -rf \"$dir\"\n        done\n    fi\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Bash Compatibility Considerations\n\nWhile fixing this, audit for other bash compatibility issues:\n- Array operations with set -u\n- Local variable declarations\n- Process substitution\n- Bash version requirements\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Test: Fresh install on macOS (binary download path) - no error\n2. Test: Install with fallback to source build - no error\n3. Test: Install with no writable dirs (triggers temp dir creation) - no error\n4. Test: Verify cleanup actually removes temp dirs when they exist\n5. Test: Various bash versions (4.x, 5.x)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] No 'unbound variable' error after successful install\n- [ ] Temp directories still cleaned up when created\n- [ ] Works with bash 4.x and 5.x\n- [ ] No regression in installation success rate\n- [ ] Error handling for actual failures preserved\n\n## Note on Issue #7\n\nThe original issue title mentions a 404 error, but that was a user typo in the URL (they had an extra 'github.com/Dicklesworthstone' in the path).

{"id":"bv-hmkz","title":"Focus Isolation: List Selection Changes During Detail View Navigation","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nWhen the detail view panel has focus (split view mode), pressing j/k or arrow keys to scroll the detail content ALSO changes the list selection in the left panel. The list visually updates to show a different selected item, even though the detail content being displayed doesn't change.\n\n## User Impact\n\n**Severity: Critical (P0)**\n- Affects ALL users in split view mode\n- Creates confusion about which issue is actually selected\n- Breaks the mental model of focus isolation\n- Reported by @ZainRizvi in GitHub Issue #12 with video evidence\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Location:** `pkg/ui/model.go:1116`\n\n```go\n// Update list for filtering input, but NOT for WindowSizeMsg\nif _, isWindowSize := msg.(tea.WindowSizeMsg); !isWindowSize {\n    m.list, cmd = m.list.Update(msg)  // ← PROBLEM: Called for ALL messages!\n    cmds = append(cmds, cmd)\n}\n```\n\nThe bubbles `list.Model` component internally handles j/k keys for navigation. This code passes ALL keyboard messages to the list, regardless of current focus state. When in `focusDetail` mode:\n\n1. `viewport.Update(msg)` is called (line 986) - correctly scrolls detail content\n2. `list.Update(msg)` is ALSO called (line 1116) - incorrectly moves list selection\n\nThe second call happens because the guard only excludes WindowSizeMsg, not keyboard messages when focus is elsewhere.\n\n## Why Detail Content Doesn't Change\n\nThe detail view shows the issue that was selected when `updateViewportContent()` was last called. Since this function is only triggered by explicit list selection changes (not by internal list.Update navigation), the displayed content stays the same even as the list cursor moves.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nGate list updates by focus state. Only forward keyboard messages to the list when `m.focused == focusList` or when the message is a non-navigation type (like filtering input, WindowSizeMsg).\n\n**Option A (Minimal change):**\n```go\n// Only update list selection when list has focus\nif m.focused == focusList {\n    if _, isWindowSize := msg.(tea.WindowSizeMsg); !isWindowSize {\n        m.list, cmd = m.list.Update(msg)\n        cmds = append(cmds, cmd)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Option B (More granular):**\nMaintain list.Update for non-navigation messages (filtering, search) while blocking j/k/arrows when unfocused.\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Create test: Split view with focusDetail, send j/k keys, verify list index unchanged\n2. Create test: Split view with focusList, send j/k keys, verify list index changes\n3. Create test: Filtering input works regardless of focus\n4. Manual test: Verify scroll in detail pane doesn't affect list selection\n5. Manual test: Verify Tab switching focus works correctly\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] j/k in detail view scrolls content, doesn't change list selection\n- [ ] j/k in list view still navigates as expected\n- [ ] Tab correctly switches focus between panels\n- [ ] Filter/search input still works from any focus state\n- [ ] New tests pass with 100% coverage of focus scenarios\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub Issue #12: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/issues/12\n- Video demonstration in issue shows exact behavior\n- Related code: handleListKeys(), focusDetail case at line 985-988","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:51:07.888533-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T00:17:04.504207-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T00:17:04.504207-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed focus isolation bug - gated list.Update on focusList state to prevent j/k keys from affecting list selection when detail view has focus","labels":["critical","gh-issue-12","ux"]}

{"id":"bv-mvvu","title":"Data Integrity: Merge Artifact Files Loaded Instead of Canonical Data","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nbv can load stale/outdated issue data when merge artifact files (`beads.left.jsonl`, `beads.base.jsonl`) are present in the `.beads/` directory. Users see closed issues as open, wrong priorities, or missing issues entirely.\n\n## User Impact\n\n**Severity: Critical (P0)**\n- Data integrity issue - users see WRONG information\n- Particularly affects users after git merge conflicts\n- Can lead to working on already-completed issues\n- Reported by @bmjjr in GitHub Issue #5, confirmed by @masonjames\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Location:** `pkg/loader/loader.go:36-56`\n\n### Problem 1: Merge Artifacts Not Skipped\n\nThe `FindJSONLPath()` function skips files containing:\n- `.backup`\n- `.orig`  \n- `.merge`\n- `deletions.jsonl`\n\nBut it does NOT skip:\n- `beads.left.jsonl` - Git merge artifact (OURS side)\n- `beads.base.jsonl` - Git merge artifact (BASE side)\n\n### Problem 2: Wrong Priority Order\n\n```go\npreferredNames := []string{\"beads.jsonl\", \"beads.base.jsonl\", \"issues.jsonl\"}\n```\n\nThis prioritizes `beads.base.jsonl` (position #2) OVER `issues.jsonl` (position #3).\n\nPer beads upstream (steveyegge/beads), `issues.jsonl` is the canonical file:\n\u003e Stage all tracked JSONL files (issues.jsonl is canonical, beads.jsonl for backward compat)\n\nSo the priority order is wrong AND merge artifacts aren't being filtered.\n\n## Scenario That Triggers Bug\n\n1. User has a beads project with `issues.jsonl` up to date\n2. Git merge conflict occurs involving `.beads/` files\n3. User resolves conflict but leaves `beads.left.jsonl` and `beads.base.jsonl` behind\n4. bv loads `beads.base.jsonl` (old data) instead of `issues.jsonl` (current data)\n5. User sees stale issue states\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Fix 1: Skip merge artifact patterns\n\n```go\n// Skip backups, merge artifacts, and deletion manifests\nif strings.Contains(name, \".backup\") ||\n    strings.Contains(name, \".orig\") ||\n    strings.Contains(name, \".merge\") ||\n    strings.HasPrefix(name, \"beads.left\") ||  // NEW\n    strings.HasPrefix(name, \"beads.base\") ||  // NEW (when issues.jsonl exists)\n    name == \"deletions.jsonl\" {\n    continue\n}\n```\n\n### Fix 2: Correct priority order\n\n```go\n// Priority order per beads upstream:\n// 1. issues.jsonl (canonical)\n// 2. beads.jsonl (backward compatibility)\n// 3. beads.base.jsonl (only if nothing else exists)\npreferredNames := []string{\"issues.jsonl\", \"beads.jsonl\", \"beads.base.jsonl\"}\n```\n\n### Fix 3: Add detection warning\n\nWhen merge artifacts are detected, emit a warning to stderr:\n```\nWarning: Merge artifact files detected in .beads/. Run 'bd clean' to remove them.\nFound: beads.left.jsonl, beads.base.jsonl\nLoading from: issues.jsonl (canonical)\n```\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Test: Directory with only issues.jsonl - loads correctly\n2. Test: Directory with issues.jsonl AND beads.left.jsonl - skips artifact, loads issues.jsonl\n3. Test: Directory with beads.jsonl AND issues.jsonl - loads issues.jsonl (new priority)\n4. Test: Warning emitted when artifacts detected\n5. Test: Fallback to beads.base.jsonl when NO other files exist\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] beads.left.jsonl always skipped\n- [ ] beads.base.jsonl skipped when canonical file exists\n- [ ] issues.jsonl prioritized over beads.jsonl\n- [ ] Warning emitted for detected merge artifacts\n- [ ] Existing tests updated, new tests added\n- [ ] No regression for projects without merge artifacts\n\n## Workaround (Current)\n\nUsers can run `bd clean` or manually delete merge artifact files.\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub Issue #5: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/issues/5\n- beads pre-commit hook: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/.beads-hooks/pre-commit#L38\n- Related: PR #18 (openInEditor hardcoded path) depends on this fix","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:51:09.478361-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T00:14:10.555056-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T00:14:10.555056-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed: 1) Skip beads.left/right merge artifacts, 2) Correct priority order (issues.jsonl canonical per beads upstream), 3) Add FindJSONLPathWithWarnings for merge artifact warnings.

Each issue has been independently verified through code analysis.\n\n## Background \u0026 Context\n\nThe bv (Beads Viewer) project received valuable community feedback identifying real bugs affecting user experience. While we don't accept outside code contributions, this feedback is essential for improving the tool.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nbv is designed as an AI sidecar tool - a fast, reliable companion for issue triage. These bugs undermine that mission:\n\n1. **Data Integrity Issues** - Showing stale/wrong data (#5) breaks user trust\n2. **UX Friction** - Focus isolation bug (#12) affects every user session\n3. **Feature Gaps** - Missing labels (#14) hides critical info\n4. **Accessibility** - Light mode issues (#17) blocks users entirely\n5. **Discoverability** - Help overlay limitations (#16) hurt onboarding\n\n### Scope\n\n**In Scope:** All verified bugs from community reports, related improvements, comprehensive test coverage.\n\n**Out of Scope:** Major new features, architecture changes beyond fixes, performance optimizations.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n1. All P0/P1 bugs resolved with tests\n2. No regression in existing functionality\n3.

{"id":"bv-y5i","title":"Static Site Export \u0026 GitHub Pages Deployment","description":"# Static Site Export \u0026 GitHub Pages Deployment\n\n## Overview\nAdd the ability to generate and deploy a slick static website that presents bv's issue tracker data to GitHub Pages (and optionally Cloudflare Pages). This feature mirrors the successful \"shared mailbox\" functionality in mcp_agent_mail, using the SAME proven SQLite + sql.js + FTS5 architecture.\n\n## Motivation \u0026 Goals\n1. **Shareability**: Allow teams to share project status without requiring bv installation\n2. **Archival**: Create point-in-time snapshots of project health for stakeholders\n3. **CI Integration**: Auto-publish project dashboards from CI pipelines\n4. **Accessibility**: View rich analysis data in any browser\n\n## Key Features\n- **Dashboard View**: Quick stats (open/blocked/actionable), health indicators, top picks\n- **Issues List**: Filterable/sortable by status, type, priority, labels, assignee\n- **Issue Detail**: Full description, dependencies (blocks/blocked-by), graph position\n- **Dependency Graph**: Interactive Mermaid.js visualization\n- **Insights View**: PageRank leaders, bottlenecks, critical path, recommendations\n- **Full-Text Search**: FTS5-powered search with ranking and snippets\n\n## Technical Approach (Matching mcp_agent_mail)\n| mcp_agent_mail Component | bv Equivalent |\n|--------------------------|---------------|\n| SQLite snapshot | SQLite export (beads.sqlite3) |\n| sql.js WASM | sql.js WASM (client-side queries) |\n| FTS5 full-text search | FTS5 full-text search |\n| Materialized views | Materialized views (issue_overview_mv) |\n| OPFS caching | OPFS caching (offline support) |\n| Database chunking | Database chunking (\u003e5MB) |\n| Message list | Issues list with SQL filtering |\n| Thread detail | Issue detail + dependency subgraph |\n| Alpine.js + Tailwind | Same stack (proven, lightweight) |\n| DOMPurify + Trusted Types | Same security approach |\n| gh CLI deployment | Same approach |\n| Cloudflare wrangler | Same approach |\n| coi-serviceworker.js | Same (COOP/COEP for OPFS) |\n\n## Bundle Structure\n```\nbv-pages/\n  index.html              # SPA entry with CSP, COOP/COEP via service worker\n  viewer.js               # Main app with sql.js integration\n  styles.css              # Tailwind + custom styles\n  beads.sqlite3           # Optimized SQLite database\n  beads.sqlite3.config.json  # Chunk config (if chunked)\n  chunks/                 # Database chunks (if \u003e5MB)\n  data/\n    triage.json           # Full --robot-triage output\n    insights.json         # Full --robot-insights output\n    plan.json             # Full --robot-plan output\n    meta.json             # Export metadata\n  vendor/\n    sql-wasm.js           # sql.js library\n    sql-wasm.wasm         # SQLite WASM binary\n    alpine.min.js         # Reactive UI framework\n    marked.min.js         # Markdown rendering\n    dompurify.min.js      # HTML sanitization\n  coi-serviceworker.js    # COOP/COEP for GitHub Pages\n  assets/\n    favicon.svg\n```\n\n## Deployment Wizard Flow (Interactive)\n1. Export options: select issues (all/filtered), include closed (yes/no)\n2. Analysis: regenerate or use cached robot outputs\n3. Target selection: GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages / Local only\n4. Prerequisites check: gh/wrangler auth, git config, confirm identity\n5. Preview: local server with hot reload\n6. Deploy: create/update repo (with safety checks), push, enable Pages\n\n## CLI Commands\n```bash\n# Full wizard (interactive)\nbv --pages\n\n# Quick export to directory\nbv --export-pages ./bv-pages\n\n# Export with options\nbv --export-pages ./bv-pages --include-closed --title \"My Project\"\n\n# Preview existing bundle\nbv --preview-pages ./bv-pages\n\n# Update existing deployment\nbv --update-pages ./bv-pages\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n- No secrets in exports (bv data is typically non-sensitive)\n- CSP headers for XSS prevention\n- DOMPurify + Trusted Types for markdown rendering\n- COOP/COEP via service worker for OPFS support\n- Safety checks before any destructive git operations\n- Permission prompts before software installation\n\n## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)\n- Historical trend charts (requires multiple snapshots)\n- Embedded search highlighting\n- PDF export option\n- Custom themes/branding\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. User can run `bv --pages` and have a live GitHub Pages site in \u003c5 minutes\n2. Site shows all data from bv TUI in readable format\n3. Site works offline after initial load (OPFS caching)\n4. Works on mobile browsers\n5. Dark mode support\n6. Full-text search works with ranking\n7. Dependency graph is interactive and useful\n\n## Architecture Rationale (Why SQLite, not JSON)\n1. **Real Search**: FTS5 provides full-text search with ranking (bm25), snippets, prefix matching\n2. **Complex Queries**: SQL handles dependency traversal, filtering, sorting without JavaScript complexity\n3. **Scale**: Same approach works for 50 or 50,000 issues\n4. **Performance**: Client queries only what it needs, pagination via LIMIT/OFFSET\n5. **Caching**: OPFS support for offline use with cache invalidation\n6. **Proven**: mcp_agent_mail demonstrates this architecture works exceptionally well\n\n## References\n- mcp_agent_mail share.py (2207 lines): Data export pipeline\n- mcp_agent_mail share_to_github_pages.py (1353 lines): Deployment wizard\n- mcp_agent_mail viewer_assets/: SPA implementation with sql.js","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:04:14.53233-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T11:28:32.763634-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T11:28:32.763634-05:00","close_reason":"All 19 component tasks completed - static site export feature fully implemented","labels":["static-pages"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-6hl","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:39.789219-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-w97","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:39.947925-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-jdl","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:40.08475-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-73f","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:40.218214-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-uun","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:40.359558-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-5yb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:40.484785-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-dyg","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:40.611898-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-vt0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:40.740656-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-10g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:40.86981-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-kdn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:41.009939-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-5dl","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:41.141716-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-50r","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:41.317964-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-406","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:41.471486-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-awl","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:41.60841-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-ake","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:41.78428-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-gv7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:41.920716-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-7pu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:10:42.090711-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-gdlt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:23:03.405438-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bv-y5i","depends_on_id":"bv-5mgw","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:40:38.95764-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"bv-zaxb","title":"Support BEADS_DIR Environment Variable for Custom Directory Location","description":"## Feature Request\n\nAllow users to specify a custom beads directory location via the BEADS_DIR environment variable. When set, it overrides the default `.beads` directory lookup.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Monorepos**: Single beads directory shared across multiple packages\n2. **Non-standard layouts**: Projects where `.beads` isn't in the working directory\n3. **Testing**: Point to test fixtures without changing directory\n4. **Cross-directory access**: View beads from anywhere on the filesystem\n\n## User Request\n\nSuggested by @burke in GitHub PR #15:\n\u003e Allow users to specify a custom beads directory location via the BEADS_DIR environment variable. When set, it overrides the default .beads directory lookup. This enables more flexible project layouts and cross-directory beads file access.\n\n## Proposed Implementation\n\n### New function in loader.go\n\n```go\n// GetBeadsDir returns the beads directory path, respecting BEADS_DIR env var.\n// If BEADS_DIR is set, it is used directly.\n// Otherwise, falls back to .beads in the given repoPath (or cwd if empty).\nfunc GetBeadsDir(repoPath string) (string, error) {\n    // Check BEADS_DIR environment variable first\n    if envDir := os.Getenv(\"BEADS_DIR\"); envDir != \"\" {\n        return envDir, nil\n    }\n\n    // Fall back to .beads in repo path\n    if repoPath == \"\" {\n        var err error\n        repoPath, err = os.Getwd()\n        if err != nil {\n            return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"failed to get cwd: %w\", err)\n        }\n    }\n\n    return filepath.Join(repoPath, \".beads\"), nil\n}\n```\n\n### Update LoadIssues to use GetBeadsDir\n\n```go\nfunc LoadIssues(repoPath string) ([]model.Issue, error) {\n    beadsDir, err := GetBeadsDir(repoPath)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    // ... rest of function\n}\n```\n\n### Update main.go for beadsPath\n\n```go\n// Get beads file path for live reload (respects BEADS_DIR)\nbeadsDir, _ := loader.GetBeadsDir(\"\")\nbeadsPath, _ = loader.FindJSONLPath(beadsDir)\n```\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n1. **Precedence**: BEADS_DIR should always win when set (explicit user intent)\n2. **Validation**: Should we validate the directory exists? Or let it fail naturally?\n3. **CLI flag alternative**: Could also add `--beads-dir` flag for one-off use\n4. **Documentation**: Add to README and help output\n\n## Priority Justification\n\nP3 (Low) because:\n- Not a bug, purely enhancement\n- Workarounds exist (cd to directory, symlinks)\n- Useful for power users but not essential\n- Should wait until data loading bugs (bv-mvvu) are fixed first\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Blocked by:** bv-mvvu (Data Integrity: Merge Artifact Files)\n- Should implement after file selection logic is corrected\n- Both touch loader.go and file resolution\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Test: BEADS_DIR set - uses that directory\n2. Test: BEADS_DIR overrides repoPath parameter\n3. Test: BEADS_DIR unset - falls back to .beads in cwd\n4. Test: BEADS_DIR points to non-existent dir - appropriate error\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] BEADS_DIR environment variable respected\n- [ ] Overrides default .beads directory lookup\n- [ ] Error handling for invalid directories\n- [ ] Tests cover all scenarios\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub PR #15: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/pull/15\n- Related: bv-mvvu (should be fixed first)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:55:14.109492-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T14:35:34.817758-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T14:35:34.817758-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented BEADS_DIR environment variable support with tests and documentation","labels":["enhancement","gh-pr-15"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bv-zaxb","depends_on_id":"bv-mvvu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:56:33.474719-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
